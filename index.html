<h2 style="font-family:Calibri;">Home Page : Instroduction to Robotics and Its Applications</h2>

<p style="font-family:Calibri;">The field of robotics encompasses the design, construction, operation, and use of robotsâ€”machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics is a multidisciplinary domain that integrates various fields such as engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and mechatronics. As technology advances, robotics continues to reshape industries, enhance daily living, and drive innovation.</p>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;">History of Robotics
    The history of robotics dates back to ancient times, with myths and legends featuring automata. However, the modern field began in the 20th century. Key milestones include:</p>
    <ul style="font-family:Calibri;">
        <li >1950s: The first programmable robot, Unimate, was developed by George Devol and later used in General Motors factories for assembly line work.</li>
        <li >1970s: The introduction of more sophisticated robotic arms, which allowed for greater precision and versatility in manufacturing processes.</li>
        <li >1980s: Advancements in AI and computer technology led to robots that could learn and adapt, enhancing their capabilities beyond mere automation.</li>
        <li >2000s-Present: The emergence of collaborative robots (cobots), drones, and autonomous vehicles, making robots accessible in various sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and transportation.</li>

<h2 style="font-family:Calibri;">Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Their Capabilities</h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;">Humanoid robots, designed to mimic the appearance and behavior of humans, represent one of the most exciting areas in robotics and artificial intelligence. These robots have gained significant attention not only for their innovative designs but also for their potential applications across various sectors, from healthcare to entertainment. As technology advances, humanoid robots are evolving to possess increasingly sophisticated capabilities, enabling them to interact with the world and humans in more meaningful ways.</p>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;">Humanoid robots are robots that resemble humans in shape, behavior, and capabilities. They typically have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, allowing them to perform tasks in a manner similar to humans. Their design often includes features such as facial expressions, speech recognition, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. The primary goal of humanoid robots is to improve human-robot interaction by making them more relatable and approachable.</p>
