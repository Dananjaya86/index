<p style="font-family:Calibri;">The field of robotics encompasses the design, construction, operation, and use of robotsâ€”machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics is a multidisciplinary domain that integrates various fields such as engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and mechatronics. As technology advances, robotics continues to reshape industries, enhance daily living, and drive innovation.</p>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;">History of Robotics
    The history of robotics dates back to ancient times, with myths and legends featuring automata. However, the modern field began in the 20th century. Key milestones include:</p>
    <ul style="font-family:Calibri;">
        <li >1950s: The first programmable robot, Unimate, was developed by George Devol and later used in General Motors factories for assembly line work.</li>
        <li >1970s: The introduction of more sophisticated robotic arms, which allowed for greater precision and versatility in manufacturing processes.</li>
        <li >1980s: Advancements in AI and computer technology led to robots that could learn and adapt, enhancing their capabilities beyond mere automation.</li>
        <li >2000s-Present: The emergence of collaborative robots (cobots), drones, and autonomous vehicles, making robots accessible in various sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and transportation.</li>
    </ul>
